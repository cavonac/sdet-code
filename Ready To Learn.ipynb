    "## A Note About Automation\n",
    "Since automation can be very quick, it is important to note that automation is often discouraged when doing security testing on \"crowd sourced testing\" services like BugFinders or BugCrowd. Testing may often require logging into a VPN service to host a testing session or it could be on live services! Automation has a tendency to cause issues so it's often banned outright. Simple automation could be used as proof of concept code for exploits. "
